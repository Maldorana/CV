#### Creative thinking

I'm just beginning to understand how much creative thinking good programming actually requires, and I'm thrilled to be using my creativity in such a refreshing way. Challenging everything I think I know, finding patterns and thinking outside the box is how I solve the most complicated problems.

#### Excellent communicator

During my time at Padawan Ldt I was in charge of compiling data and designing the monthly newsletters for stakeholders, with our products' new features, updates on the latest projects and the analysis of the previous releases.
I have continued to develop my written communication skills by [blogging](https://alpha-blog-on-rails.herokuapp.com/) about my experience learning to code.
